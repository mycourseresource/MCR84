plug in your device and verify if the driver is loaded by typing on a terminal window:
lsmod | grep  ftdi_sio
Id you get an answer, then it's loaded. If you don't get an answer, try
sudo modprobe ftdi_sio
If you boot next time and it is not loaded automatically, then make (as root) an entry into your /etc/modules file. Just put ftdi_sio at the end of the file


The Linux kernel team decided to remove some modules from the base kernel to allow "virtual" images to be slimmed down. The extra modules are moved into linux-image-extra and you can get them installed by typing [https://newbedev.com/how-to-install-usbserial-and-ftdi-sio-modules-to-14-04-trusty-vagrant-box]:

sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-virtual



Useful commands:
lsusb
sudo dmesg | grep tty    (port of the USB to Serial converter)
sudo dmesg    (try after plugging in the USB to console cable => will show USB cable details)

This is the fix:

Install in Ubuntu terminal: sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-raspi
Run: dmesg | grep tty    #this will show you the serial port, e.g. ttyUSB0
Install sudo apt install putty
Run sudo putty  #this will start PuTTY
In PuTTY configuration select a valid font (this may not be required?)
In PuTTY configuration select "Connection Type:" "Serial"
In Serial line field enter serial port, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0
In Speed field enter 115200 for Mikrotik equipment
Click "Open" to start session
